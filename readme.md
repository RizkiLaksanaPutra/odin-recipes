# Odin Recipes

Welcome! This repository showcases my learning journey through the Odin Project. Below, you'll find a summary of what I've accomplished and learned.

## Introduction
This project is part of my learning journey with the Odin Project. It includes knowledges that I have implemented to practice and improve my web development skills.

## Project Overview
The Odin Recipes project is a simple website that displays a collection of recipes. Each recipe includes a list of ingredients, step-by-step instructions, and images.

## Languages Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Lessons Learned
Throughout this project, I have learned:
- Basic HTML structure
- Basic CSS for styling web pages
- Create a carousel image using JavaScript (this is outside of what TOP (The Odin Project) asks, but I found the JS code on YouTube and wanted to try it)

Thank you for visiting my Odin Recipes project! Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback.
